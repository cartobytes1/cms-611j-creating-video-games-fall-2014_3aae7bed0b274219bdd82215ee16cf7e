The Game
--------

![A screenshot of the game Saving Gora Gora.](/coursemedia/cms-611j-creating-video-games-fall-2014/520ab8743e5dfe2f6aab59df91408e61_savinggoragora.png)

_Saving Gora Gora_ is a game that tries to inform players about the causes, symptoms, and prevention of Cholera. The game accomplishes this goal by building its gameplay around a children's story, in which you, the player, must discover what is making the town of Gora Gora sick, and prove the innocence of another character.
